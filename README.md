# UniqueFactorial World of Engineer trivia implementation
## context:
loops through an integer (as string), in which, when came across with, will show if it is equal to the sum of individual factorials with respect to the placement.
e.g.
1 = 1!
145 = 1! + 4! + 5!
the loop will loop forever until you Interrupt it manually in the terminal.

no, this is not a code for 4sum with a very bad time complexity of probably O(n^3)

I probably wont include the optimized version of 4 sum unless I have a bigger understanding of hashmaps and probably after providing one helper function to atleast have it do the work for me? or yeah, probably not, I'd probably just spend time before finding an optimum code for 4sums bcs u kno ;-; 4sum,,,,
